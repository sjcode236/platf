**Node Exporter**    
Node Exporter is an official project maintained by the Prometheus team. It is an agent that runs on your servers and translates system-level hardware metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) into a format that Prometheus can read and collect.
Node Exporter (The Collector): Acts as your server's "sensors." It reads current machine metrics and exposes them on a local web page (usually port 9100). It does not store or analyze this data itself.    

**Prometheus (The Collector & Database):**  Acts as the central "brain." It goes out to your servers at regular intervals, pulls (scrapes) the data from Node Exporter, stores it historically as a time-series database, and allows you to query it for alerts and dashboards.
