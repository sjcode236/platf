---Ben Treynor Sloss , Founder of Google SRE 

SRE is an approach to IT operations 
    -Maintains a dev/ops split 
    -But adds engineering to "ops"
Shares goals with DevOps 
    - Breaking down silos 
    - Increasing quality and velocity 

Toil 
    - Labour intensive repetative work 
    - Reactive work to some trigger /error / alerts 
    
 SRE restrict  Toil work to 50% of time and another 50% allocate to Strategic work (Engineering)
    - oncall work falls under Toil 
    -
